"Taken to an extreme, I would agree. 

Personally, I have known a few long-term Vegans, but it takes a considerable amount of effort to do it long term without compromising health. 

Some varieties just aren't viable at all like raw vegans - we just no longer have the gastrointestinal tract to pull it off.

On a practical level, we're solid opportunist omnivores that adapt well to all sorts of environment...but in general the more meat you got in say competing Hunter-Gatherer societies - the better off you were from population size, or height/weight metrics.",109,3,TrueUnpopularOpinion

"Not consuming milk isn't a problem. Lactose tolerance isn't natural to human beings. You can get more calcium from spinach. As for the macros in milk, a vegan diet can easily consist of complete macros. I think iodine is probably the hardest nutrient vegans to acquire bc they would need to eat kelp and seawed in relatively substantial servings to get it,  or way too much salt. I'm not, nor could I ever be vegan due to anemia, but I also don't care to be vegan.",3,1,TrueUnpopularOpinion
"""You can get more calcium from spinach.""

No, you can't. 

From a purely metric standpoint, yes, spinach contains more calcium than milk. But our bodies don't absorb nearly as much calcium from spinach as we do from milk. The higher concentration of calcium in spinach is irrelevant if your body is only absorbing a small percentage of it, which is why milk is a better source of calcium for us than spinach, because we absorb more calcium from milk than we do from spinach. 

Your point about lactose tolerance being unnatural is also incorrect. Human milk (breast milk) actually contains more lactose than cow's milk. If we weren't adapted to absorb lactose, then breastfeeding would be very dangerous for babies.

Lactose tolerance isn't something humans build up over time, lactose INtolerance is. Lactose intolerance develops from the human body losing its ability to break down and absorb lactose, not from never having had that ability in the first place.",1,0,TrueUnpopularOpinion

"I wouldn't be surprised to find that those minimal animal sources could shore up quite a few of the nutrient deficiencies all on their own, particularly B12, which is notoriously mostly from animal sources. The distinction between vegetarian and vegan often hinges on that.

Soy often gets cited as a potential source, but my understanding is that it is usually fortified with it, not a natural source. The others are mostly fungi like mushrooms, yeast, and some seaweeds.

I would be interested in how the Vegetarian / Vegan approach in India stacks up against their meat eating fellow citizens.",10,3,TrueUnpopularOpinion

I’ll wait for those sources. If you like, I can give you mine. I studied health and nutrition and can absolutely disprove this sentiment beyond reasonable doubt.

"You can get your sources of amino acids and important minerals and vitamins from supplements of course, but not everyone has the money to buy ten vitamins and minerals and don't say multi-vitamin, because affordable multi-vitamins don't contain the bio-active versions of the minerals. For example, magnesium carbonate is harder to absorb then magnesium citrate.

I personally don't eat allot of meat, but I do buy steaks about once a week simply, because they are delicious and as for my other sources of meat I eat allot of chicken and eggs. I can feed 20 chickens for like 5$ a month if you buy chicken feed in bulk. I can feed my goats with just grass and some animal feed.

My chickens and goats live nice comfortable lives in their insulated pens at night and walk around my 2 1/2 acres of fenced in property during the day. I hold them every day and look after their every need. In exchange i get milk from my goats and eggs from my chickens. I get a constant supply of high calorie nutrition for less than the cost of a effective multi-vitamin every month. Breakfast every single day for 5$ a month.

It is nice that you can afford to eat a full spectrum diet of vegetables and supplements not everyone can.  Also overeating highly fatty meat can cause disease, obesity is caused by going over your daily caloric intake, diabetes is caused by excess blood sugar levels which you can get from non-animal sources.

&#x200B;

On diabetes you would have to be a terrible scientist and honestly dietician to tell your pre-diabetic patients to cut out lean meats from their diet instead of maybe soda or candy. Let's not pretend that excessive carbohydrate either simple or complex in our society isn't responsible for the vast majority of diabetes in our society.

Furthermore, the association with cancer and meat is from high temperature smoked meat or highly processed meat that has been cured by nitrates or nitrites.

Spinach contains 24mg of nitrites per 100 grams bacon contains 0.38 milligrams of nitrites per 100grams of bacon. Interestingly enough the nitrites in spinach are non-harmful due to the presence of other nutrients for example Vitamin C can prevent nitrites from transforming into harmful nitrogen containing compounds that have been proven to be cancerous. So, if you for example drank a glass of orange juice with your bacon you would be fine.

The risk is relatively small 13%, and you have to eat 50 grams of high nitrate meat. Like bacon or jerky every single day or almost every day. The risk of cancer goes away almost entirely If you just have an orange. It really is funny, because traditional breakfast is bacon, eggs, a slice of toast and a glass of orange juice. Nutrient dense, high protein, nice balanced breakfast and delicious. Keep eating your tofu and celery breakfast fam just don't expect us to stop eating bacon with our orange juice.  

 One slice of bacon is on average 11 grams, so you need to eat 5 slices of bacon every day to have a 13% higher risk of cancer. Lots of versions of meat don't have these nitrates or nitrites.",7,3,TrueUnpopularOpinion

"Every plant has a differing amount of every essential amino acid. A mix of plants, which everyone will eat since nobody is gorging themselves on just spinach or jsut carrots, ticks that box without having to even think about it.

As for vitamins and other essential nutrients, they’re all in the plants already. Again, where do you think the animals get them from? Plants. From eating plants. Vegans just go straight to the source.

As for diabetes? Think of it like a lock and key. Insulin is the key, your cells are the lock. If someone put chewing gum in your lock, no matter how good your key or lock are, you’re never getting that door open. In the case of your body, saturated fat, specifically animal fat, is the chewing gum. 

We literally studied case after case of people being cured from their diabetes BY cutting out all animal foods. Take out the saturated fat, take out the chewing gum, and the problem clears up.",2,1,TrueUnpopularOpinion

"Usually pre-cooked they’re talking about, which nobody does. Even if they’re talking about cooked though, there’s a lot of problems in those ‘studies’. If you look into most of them, they’re based on individual food sources fed to (usually) rats in extremely high doses. As I said, nobody is gorging themselves on purely spinach. You’ll tend to find most vegans eat more varied foods than their omni counterparts on average, despite technically having fewer options.

But even if you don’t, just stick an average meal with a few plants into chronometer and you’ll see that everything is covered. My usual lunch of sweet potatoes, peppers, mushrooms, red onion, falafels/tofu, lentils, pasta/rice and leaves with seasoning typically ticks off all my day’s nutritional needs in one sitting. And takes less than 20 minutes to prepare and 20 minute to cook and is delicious every time.

It’s actually quite easy to get all your nutrition done in one meal with plants. When you substitute half those plants for an animal source though, it gets more difficult due to their calorie dense, nutrient not so dense nature.",2,0,TrueUnpopularOpinion

Vegans aren’t miserable because of their nutrients. But there is some data that shows many vegans are more empathetic and can therefore have an higher chance of being depressed in that sense. But they “push it into others” because they genuinely care about animals. No matter how annoying they are it’s because they genuinely care.

I’ve graduated health and nutrition, and can say for a fact you are profoundly incorrect. Just because you grew up eating meat and milk and have formed an emotional connection to doing so doesn’t mean it’s healthy, I’m afraid. Some of us grew up, and don’t need breast juice in our coffee every day just to function.

How are your intramyocellular lipid levels? I’m assuming much worse than a vegan’s, if you’re eating meat. Which puts you on a much more likely path to end up with diabetes, heart disease and obesity.

How about your IGf-1 levels? Send us a picture of your face and back, we can get a rough estimate by the acne present. It’s a good indication of how likely you are to develop a hormonal cancer down the line too, since IgF-1 plays an integral role in every stage of both diseases, and really is only found in animal by-products.

Or maybe you’d like to tell us your cholesterol levels based on your recent blood works, since you’re apparently an expert? I’m sure you’re the type to believe that having big fluffy LDL won’t harm you, but it’s been scientifically proven to do nothing but detriment for your body. 

How about your TMAO levels? Another indicator of future cancer. Another “nutrient” found exclusively in animal by-products.

She use to eat eggs but she’s influenced by others more than me and people gave her the business about eating mostly vegan and eating eggs so she wrote those off. Too bad because the nutrient profile is so good. 

Meanwhile I eat many different ways. My body gets attached to a meal plan and stops being healthy it’s really weird. I do however avoid dairy as it inflames me. Small amounts I can tolerate but that’s about it. I do opt for vegan substitutions for cheese because that doesn’t mess me up and I love cheese and when I have it I want a lot like at least enough to fill a couple burritos 😂

A healthy well planned vegan diet is safe for all stages of life including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

I have been vegan for 4 years now I have a normal period and no health problems.
When I was eating omnivorously I used to have horrible dizziness from iron deficiency Anemia it went away when I started to eat vegan. 

What I do is eat desserts, whole grain pasta, rice, breads, plant milk, veggies, tofu, beans, lentils, legumes, fortified foods that have B12 and omega -3 DHA’s (fish have dha only because they eat  algae so asa vegan I just get it by getting the algae directly) I also take a supplement just fro back up. 

The ex vegans and unhealthy vegans are normally the fruitivore who eat literally only fruits who don’t even have a good protein sources like beans, legumes, lentils etc who don’t even take anything like a supplement or fortified food that has vitamin B12 and omega 3 DHA’s

People are so quick to blame and quit veganism for their problems when they might be doing the vegan diet wrong or have other issues that need to be addressed.

I recommend to research on nutritional science since there's a lot of misinformation on nutrition nowadays. Instead of listening to influencers online or anecdotes, listen to people in the nutritional science field and try to read through credible scientific papers. 

Other than that, veganism isn't purely a diet and not every vegan is focused on the nutrition side, whole plant food based diets is more focused on the health aspects. The vegans you must be talking about aren't focused on health I guess because I would say this is generally incorrect.

"I completely understand that. I am not saying there is anything wrong with being vegan and it is actually a fairly healthy diet if followed correctly. That's the key though and the issue with it. In my experience most people I have seen who become vegan or try the diet aspect of the lifestyle do become unhealthy and deficient in many nutrients. The reason isn't the fact that the diet itself is necessarily bad. It's that THEIR diet is bad. Same with most cult like diets. They tend to be harder to follow and can be harder to sustain. Like you said it's more than just a diet though it's a lifestyle. I see many people follow the lifestyle because they care about animals but don't actually enjoy the vegan diet. Some actually just hate vegetables in their raw form. Which leads them to eating ultra processed vegan foods instead of actually eating fruits and vegetables they cook. This is what leads to health issues because just like any other processed food in a diet those aren't really the most healthy diet options. There are many studies that show vegans potentially become deficient in certain nutrients like iron, omega-3s, low amount of zinc absorption, b12, and protein.

Like I said being vegan can be healthy. You and your circle may do everything correctly which leads you to believe the diet is amazing. Realistically though studies do show vegans tend to have a lot of deficiencies because you do get a lot of nutrients from meat and fish that you otherwise don’t get from vegetables alone. A lot of the foods you may get them from don’t actually have them in it naturally. 

Yes any diet can be bad. Keto, carnivore, juice cleanses, all fruit diets, and atkins are all examples.

Animal products and meat is not what makes people fat in America. America is typically one of the fattest countries because of our lifestyles and because people eat higher amounts of fast food leading to a surplus of calories. Look up the healthiest countries in the world by diet. All of them consist of eating meat still. If you look at people who eat all meat they are typically very very skinny. It’s not healthy but the reason why they are skinny is because fat and protein keeps you full for a long time leading to you eating fat less. Look up Mark Haub and his Twinkie diet. He ate nothing but steak, twinkies, cookies, and milk for 3 months while tracking and only eating 1800 calories. He lost 27lbs. Had blood work done before and after and his blood work came back better after just from losing weight. 

Saying you can find 5 unhealthy people to every 1 vegan in America is kind of pointless because most people have bad diets. If you took only people who are very specific diets weighing everything and making sure they get good portions from every food group including red meat vs the average vegan the other person would most likely be more healthy.

I have raised cows and chickens when I was younger at my dad's family farm, gave them names and cried when I killed them for sustenance, but Charlie the cow made an excellent burger. 

I 100% disagree with the mass production of animals the way we currently have the system in order to keep up with production. But if we were in a country where eating your dog was the norm, I wouldn't think twice about eating fido. I personally couldn't do it because I haven't lived in an area where that's culturally appropriate.

"First of all, people think that by me talking about how animal agriculture is unethical somehow means that I think I’m better than them? I’m sorry dude , you are projecting. I never said that. That is something that nonvegans say to hate vegans for some reason.  I ate animal products until I was 12 years old , and only went vegan 6 years ago . I don’t think I’m better than anyone else. The reason I speak about my views on animal agriculture is bc it’s relevant to the conversation or I’m trying to spread information bc people don’t really even think about what happens to the animals they are eating. You can spread awareness and facts while not thinking you are better than anyone else. We were all raised this way. There are many people in my life I love who are nonvegans. Veganism has nothing to do with me, it’s about the animals. 

Hate to break it to you, but you are not a wild animal that lives in the wilderness and eating flesh with your bare hands. We have evolved from that and have something called a moral compass and grocery stores. You are driving to a store in a car, paying money for a plastic wrapped piece of dead animal from god knows where, and taking it home and cooking it. You are not a lion or a heyena. You are a dude who is choosing to eat meat and dairy even though it’s completely healthy to not eat them. I get it, we are all raised this way. But the “lions tho” argument is just reaching as well. 

However, I’m not taking anything you say seriously bc your suggesting a tree is sentient. Do trees feel emotions, literally make friends, feel joy and pain, have central nervous systems, mourn their dead, are smart as 2 year old children’s and literal brains . They don’t. You are reaching. That’s probably the most ridiculous argument to defend eating animals I ever heard. 

Circle of life? So we are advanced and so skilled that we pay all our money for animals to be locked in disgusting factory farms where they endure abusive practices and die in a slaughterhouse in terror? How is that natural? It’s not. 99% of US farm animals live on factory farms. However free range farms still exploit animals and they die brutal  unnecessary  deaths…. All for your taste buds.

I hope veganism becomes more popular so we can make an impact in reducing the amount of farms exploiting , abusing, and murdering sentient beings that are no different than the dog you love so much.""

I say that nature intended us to occasionally eat meat because we evolved naturally with canines and that vegans who play the ""we shouldn't do it ever at all because animals have feelings"" card always acts like they're better than omnivores. I assumed based on what other vegans say, and the fact that you commented ""it's 100% wrong"" when I completely agree the way we mass execute cattle, pigs and chickens are wrong, but it is still nessisary for the equilibrium to the ecosystem.

Morals are subjective. Grocery stores are the reason livestock is treated so poorly.

You have no idea where the vegetables and fruit you eat comes from either. Majority of our crops are genetically modified to be completely different than their natural, from the dirt counterparts. Bananas had larger seeds. Lemons are man made. Tomatoes and strawberries are significantly smaller in nature.

>You are a dude who is choosing to eat meat and dairy even though it’s completely healthy to not eat them

I am vegetarian for the most part, I occasionally partake in a steak or hamburgers but mostly follow a pescatarian diet if I get into a meat mood. Because I like to keep my diet well balanced as much as possible for health reasons.

>However, I’m not taking anything you say seriously bc your suggesting a tree is sentient.

The definition of sentience is the ability to experience emotions and sensations. That's it. All of life, by definition, is sentient. Trees do in fact feel a sort of pain and are even able to heal themselves when you cut a branch from their trunks. Trees are able to communicate to other trees to warn them of potential dangers either from insect invasion or being cut down. If that's not ""emotion or sensation"" then I don't know what is.

>we pay all our money for animals to be locked in disgusting factory farms where they endure abusive practices and die in a slaughterhouse in terror? How is that natural?

Never once did I say mass production of animal meat was natural. I simply said eating meat is completely natural as proven by our canines. We as humans, aren't supposed to be consuming meat to the extreme levels we are and that is most definitely a huge problem. I don't disagree that factory farms should be outlawed and that small time ranchers should be dominant over big cooperations that have completely fucked the ecosystem and natural food chain for profit. The way we treat livestock in factory farms is horrendous and absolutely needs to end. But completely ignoring that most people genuinely don't care and in fact, end up becoming more of a carnivore because of things like you said in your first comment.

>You said yourself you would cry when slaughtering the animals. Thats called having empathy. Recognizing that these are individual beings … their life matters to them.

Everyone's life matters to themselves. But guess what? In the grand scheme of things, none of our lives matter to anyone else. That's exactly how it is for animals. Also I cry at alot of shit. Me having emotions or empathy isn't going to stop me from doing whatever I want.

Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources and are associated with much less environmental damage. Vegetarians and vegans are at reduced risk of certain health conditions, including ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain types of cancer, and obesity.  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3662288/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3662288/)

A healthy, plant-based diet requires planning, reading labels, and discipline. The recommendations for patients who want to follow a plant-based diet may include eating a variety of fruits and vegetables that may include beans, legumes, seeds, nuts, and whole grains and avoiding or limiting animal products, added fats, oils, and refined, processed carbohydrates. The major benefits for patients who decide to start a plant-based diet are the possibility of reducing the number of medications they take to treat a variety of chronic conditions, lower body weight, decreased risk of cancer, and a reduction in their risk of death from ischemic heart disease.

"Not making a political point AT ALL. This is just an observation based on anecdote. I feel like more vegans are heavily liberal than not (it's just what I've noticed in my life, Ive met many), they don't eat eggs at all, no matter what because they see eating the unborn baby as wrong, but they are pro choice. 

Just an observation. *winces*

Anyone vegan, and prochoice for more than just cases where the mothers life is being saved, how do you justify the moral dichotomy?

"not vegan but it’s not about eating an unborn baby, it’s about how unethical the egg/dairy/meat industry is, it’s truly a horrid industry. I’ve talked to a lot of vegans and many of them have said they would totally eat animal products if the industry was more ethical",1,1,TrueUnpopularOpinion
"So a vegan who had a chicken coop and gave the animals a great life could eat them and their unborn babies? I'm actually curious. I haven't thought on this much before.

Your point regarding _eating_ the unborn baby is taken. This is another thing (and ultimately a moot argument) that confuses me. If I killed a deer, and told a vegan I'm just going to throw it's meat in the trash, why _not_ eat it? Seems worse to waste it, but I've had instances where a vegan _will_ toss meat. 

Also, to your point about vegans sometimes being willing to eat animal products if they weren't factory farmed, does that really make them a vegan? Or just currently on a vegan diet by circumstance?",1,0,TrueUnpopularOpinion

">Veganism is truly unhealthy.

Not an opinion. Just factually incorrect.

>People that have been on a truly vegan diet are generally unhealthy

Wrong. People who don't plan their diet are generally unhealthy. Leading dietetics associations have said that a vegan diet is healthy for all stages of life. It's not the diet, it's the people, causing issues.

>Their body's are deprived of crucial nutrition that they can't replace with synthetic vitamins. 

Which is personal choice. There's not a single essential nutrient to humans that you can't easily get on a vegan diet. Again, leading dietetics associations have said it's health for all stages of life.

>I believe that is why so many of them believe that they have to push their beliefs onto others, because they are absolutely miserable due to their bodies being starved.

No, their bodies are not being starved. And the reason most 'push their beliefs' is because you are harming sentient beings. Just like people 'push their beliefs' when they are against pet abuse, domestic abuse, etc. No equating every action, just saying that when people are opposed to harm that others cause, *obviously* they will push that belief. And you trying to claim it's due to them being starved instead is ridiculous.

>I post my opinion on a truly vegan diet, and most comments are telling me how wrong I am. 

Your opinion goes against reality. Your opinion goes against facts. Obviously you will have people telling you how wrong you are. If you said the world was flat it would be the same situation. It's so ridiculous for you to make an incorrect statement and spread misinformation and then moan when people point out that you are wrong, and you somehow use that *against them*.

"I was vegan for a year, and I can tell ya, it’s extremely difficult to stay healthy. When you cut out so many sources of nutrients, it’s hard to fill the gaps.

Things like minerals and some amino acids, for example. I think it can be done healthily, but the amount of effort it takes is absurd. 

After a year, I was in a bad way. I was indescribably exhausted all the time, even though I was putting in so much effort to cover all my bases.

However it depends on availability and the generations long cultural cooking practices.

Veganism is not inherently unhealthy. While it is true that following a vegan diet may lead to inadequate intake of certain vitamins and minerals, it is possible to have a healthy and balanced vegan diet by ensuring proper nutrition and considering supplementation when necessary.

Several studies have shown that a vegan diet can decrease the risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (source: ""Vegetarian, vegan diets and multiple health outcomes: A systematic review with meta-analysis of observational studies"" by Dinu et al., 2017). This indicates that a well-planned vegan diet can have positive health effects.

However, it is important to note that veganism has been associated with adverse health outcomes in some cases. These outcomes include nervous, skeletal, and immune system impairments, as well as hematological disorders (source: ""Vegetarian diets and the incidence of cancer in a low-risk population"" by Tantamango-Bartley et al., 2013). It is crucial to ensure a balanced vegan diet that includes a variety of plant-based foods to avoid nutrient deficiencies.

It is true that some vegans may push their beliefs onto others, but it is important to recognize that this behavior is not representative of all vegans. Veganism has risen in popularity recently due to ethical, environmental, and health concerns. Many individuals choose to follow a vegan lifestyle for personal reasons and do not engage in militant or aggressive behavior.

To address the concern about nutrient deficiencies, it is important for vegans to pay attention to their intake of vitamins B12 and D, calcium, and iron. Plant-based sources of calcium include kale, almonds, oranges, and legumes. Additionally, supplementation may be necessary to ensure adequate nutrient levels (source: ""Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets"" by Melina et al., 2016).

In conclusion, veganism can be a healthy and inclusive dietary choice when approached with proper planning and consideration of nutrient needs. It is important to debunk stereotypes and misconceptions about vegans and recognize that a well-balanced vegan diet can provide numerous health benefits.",1,0,TrueUnpopularOpinion

">A cult can be described, by definition, as a misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing. Vegans, without a doubt, do this for animals.

You're going to have to provide more support for this claim than ""without a doubt.""

Vegans just want to try to avoid harming nonhuman animals, just like other people typically want to avoid harming other humans.

If it's cult-like to not want to harm other nonhuman animals, then why is it not cult-like to not want to harm other human animals?

>Vegans claim that sentience is the determining factor for their diet yet also say eating non-sentient clams , oysters , honey and the like is also wrong.

To be completely fair, there is a lot of discussion and disagreement in the vegan community on this. Many vegans have absolutely no moral objection to eating oysters and clams, and some even have no objection to honey (although I'm not sure it's as easy to argue that bees are non-sentient.)

>Veganism puts the individual in an unhealthy God like position by expressing that one life ( sentient or not ) has more value than another. 

Did you mean to say this? This seems to be the exact opposite of what vegans believe.

>Veganism is physically unhealthy because without supplements or fortified foods you will not receive enough vitamin B12. 

But most vegans live in places where B12 supplements are cheap and accessible, right? I could see if you were making this argument in like the 1950s or something, but not today in 2018.

Do you avoid all supplements and fortified foods? Do you think that the governments of the world should stop encouraging salt packers to supplement their product with iodine?

>In other words if you simply buy fruits and vegetables from your local farmers market and do not supplement with B12 you will suffer irreversible neurological damage due to B12 deficiency. 

Yes, if you are a vegan that doesn't get all of the nutrients that are needed to be healthy, you will likely not be healthy. However, if you are a vegan and *do* get all of the nutrients needed to be healthy, you will likely be healthy.

You're basically saying ""IF vegans don't do this thing, they will be unhealthy, while not giving any reason as to why vegans cannot simply do that thing.

>Vegan diets also do not contain real vitamin A ( retinol) only the precursors for vitamin A . Some people cannot convert this form into vitamin A and the results are disastrous.

Why is this a problem with veganism? If someone has a medical condition where they can't consume gluten, we don't say that diets with gluten are inherently unhealthy; we say that *for that individual*, diets with gluten are unhealthy. If a person cannot convert carotenoids to vitamin A, then that is not an issue with veganism, but with that person.

Furthermore, the definition of veganism includes the phrase ""as much as is possible and practicable."" This means that even if someone simply cannot be healthy without eating some amount of animal products, then it would not conflict with veganism for them to do so. If someone *needs* to eat a bit of animal meat here and there in order to be healthy due to some rare disorder or medical condition, then they could do so and still be vegan.

>Zinc is only found in limited sources in a vegan diet 

Zinc is an essential nutrient and is found in many plant based foods, including legumes, nuts, seeds, and oats. It is also found fortified in many foods and beverages and available in supplement form. We do not need to consume this from animal sources to be healthy.

>iron is absorbed up to 3x times more when we eat meat and is essential in preventing dangerous illnesses such as anemia.

Non-Heme iron from non-animal sources can provide all of the iron the body requires and can be found in many plant based foods, including soybeans, lentils, tofu, beans, spinach, and other green vegetables. It is also found fortified in many foods and beverages and available in supplement form. While it is true that by themselves, these sources of iron do not absorb as well as animal source, but this absorption is aided by the consumption of foods high in vitamin C, which vegetarians and vegans usually consume in higher quantities than non-vegetarians. ""Incidence of iron deficiency anemia among vegetarians is similar to that of nonvegetarians. Although vegetarian adults have lower iron stores than nonvegetarians, their serum ferritin levels are usually within the normal range"" --The American Dietetic Association https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1989423 We do not need to consume iron from animal sources to be healthy.",13,1,CMV

I can't say what everyone does. But I can say that those of us who are not vegan are not compelled to do so by tenet.

I'm not sure what point of mine this is addressing. Is it my request for more support for your claim that vegans have a ""misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing""? I guess I'm not seeing how anything the vegan society does qualifies as this, let alone the larger vegan movement in general. Can you perhaps explain further?

>We don't eat humans ( most of us anyway ) and killing a human for food and most other circumstances is against the law .

This is very true, but it doesn't answer my question. If it is cult-like to not want to kill animals, than why is it not cult-like to not want to kill humans? Simply saying that most humans don't harm other humans and that it's illegal doesn't address this, unless you're saying that something that most humans do can never be cult-like, or that anything illegal is cult-like.

>There are outliers in all communities . All the data I've looked at leans towards the majority view of not consuming these products.

Have you controlled for all possible confounding factors? Like, I'm a vegan and I don't eat oysters, but not *because* I am vegan. I simply don't like them or really have any desire to eat them. In fact, there are a lot of *non-vegans* that also don't eat oysters.

Vegans typically don't see any reason to avoid consuming oysters for moral or ethical reasons. There are some vegans that think that bivalves might have an extremely simple or limited form of sentience, and that we can't really rule it out completely based on the information we currently have, so they give them the benefit of the doubt and don't eat them. 

>Vegans value animal life over plant life. Yes I meant to say that .

Yes. So do most non-vegans. I don't see many people getting upset a dog walks on the grass. This doesn't really seem like a vegan issue.

>I don't salt my foods or eat fortified foods ( such as milk fortified with vitamin D) because my diet affords me that choice .

Are you certain that you don't eat *any* foods that were made with iodized salt? Do you never eat at restaurants and buy only non-premade whole foods?

Are you certain that you don't eat *any* fortified foods? It's nearly impossible in the modern developed world to buy bread or cereal with no fortification. Do you ask at every restaurant if the bread or rice they use is fortified?

Supplementation and fortification is important, even for non-vegans, which is why it's so ubiquitous.


>I'm not saying some of these vitamins are impossible to find in plants I'm saying getting enough is an obstacle , while some like vitamin B12 cannot be received from unfortified plant based foods at all .

So taking that into consideration, would you then agree that if someone takes appropriate measures to overcome this obstacle, that they can get all the nutrients necessary to be healthy?

Sentience is the main factor in determining what vegans eat the rest is peripheral. More insects are killed in harvesting produce than honey . 

Vegans determine which life has more value by default . If you choose one over the other you are making a value judgment  . I eat a well rounded diet including plants and animals because I do not value animals more than plants where my diet is concerned.

"I’m not vegan, but vegetarian, and I’d have to disagree with some exceptions. First, your definition of a cult is oversimplified at best. Real psychologists define a cult by the BITE model, meaning to be a cult a group must exhibit control over people’s behavior, information, thoughts and emotion. 

I’m sure there are some subreddits or forums where vegans can distance themselves from outside information, but in no way are they cut off from opposing sources, nor are they shunned for thinking the wrong things. Behavior might be the only way their lives are actually controlled, but it is not inflicted on them forcefully and therefore can’t be considered cult-like behavior according to this model.

In terms of physical health, I can’t really say for sure it doesn’t cause any harm. There are obviously some plant based foods containing protein and other nutrients. At the end of the day, everything in an animal cane from a plant first so one could expect to find all necessary nutrients in some plant somewhere. ",3,1,CMV
"Thanks , actually in a prior reply someone described the popularized definition of cult ( i.e. cult of personality) which is what I had been using verses the classic definition. I now agree that vegans do not fit the classic definition of a cult .  As far as health goes you cannot get vitamin B12 by eating only a plant based diet without scientific intervention. Plants  or plant products ( soy or almond milk for example ) must be fortified with it . One may say that it is still a healthy diet because fortifying foods is a  common practice or one might say that on a level playing field ( vegan vs standard diet with no foods modified) a vegan diet is unhealthy as a B12 deficiency leads to an agonizing death of neurological destruction.

The waste they create is so concentrated it poisons the earth around it.

But I own chickens, I don’t own a lot, they get to play in the grass, they are happy to see me, they get to live until old age. I eat their eggs, because they weren’t created by a harmful and cruel industrial processing plant....

">Vegans claim that sentience is the determining factor for their diet yet also say eating non-sentient clams , oysters , honey and the like is also wrong

There are lots of vegans - myself included. Who don't see a huge problem with those things - but avoid them to give them the 'benefit of the doubt' 

> Veganism is physically unhealthy because without supplements or fortified foods you will not receive enough vitamin B12.

Same with an omnivorous diet. Farm animals are supplemented with b12. Before we sterilised all our food/drink we got it from rivers, dirty veg, etc. Appeal to nature fallacy regardless.

>Vegan diets also do not contain real vitamin A ( retinol) only the precursors for vitamin A . Some people cannot convert this form into vitamin A and the results are disastrous. Zinc is only found in limited sources in a vegan diet ( many vegans find it difficult to get enough ) while iron is absorbed up to 3x times more when we eat meat and is essential in preventing dangerous illnesses such as anemia.

Again, appeal to nature. Just supplement those things.",1,1,CMV
"I have no idea what statistically ""a lot "" means .

When I kill two elk and I have unadulterated meat for more than  a  year .

Again , on a level playing field  where both diets are not modified by science , man can subsist comfortably as an omnivore.  On the same level playing field man will die a slow painful death as  his neurological functions are damaged beyond repair from B12 deficiency by  eating nothing but plants . That is a fact .

"> I have no idea what statistically ""a lot "" means .

There's no polls or studies. Just a discussions from vegans. Saying you can't eat oysters is just an arbitrary distinction as any speciest argument.

So what? You don't need to do those things - you can eat other things.

It's an appeal to nature fallacy is what it is. You could eat your own shit and get b12 if you really wanted to be puritan about it....I'll stick to the supplements.

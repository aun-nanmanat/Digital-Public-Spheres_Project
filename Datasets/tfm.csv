"This is also miss information, deer meet typically does not have enough fat in it to make a patty, it's normally ground with pork fat, so it would be deer and pork at the very least.

Meat makes my stomach hurt badly and I get nauseous. So I’m vegetarian because of it although I have nothing against it at all. I wish I could eat it without feeling sharp pains. So many people when I talk about being vegetarian start talking shit to me and bad mouthing plant based things or non meat diets and it’s like wow I’m fucking sorry that it makes me feel like shit. Or they post pics of them eating meat and it’s like ok?? I’m not going to melt because you’re eating a burger.,2,1,terriblefacebookmemes
The version of this with deer makes me laugh because you mix deer with a fattier meat when ground,2,0,terriblefacebookmemes
It's mostly Wrong tho. If you don't have a Self-Hunted Steak you would not want to know what is in like Chiken nuggets or Schnitzel or anything animal-based. Plant based is always a very healthy alternative.,2,0,terriblefacebookmemes
"As one of those ""Autistic"" people who have a thing for textures and all that... I've actually stopped eating animal products not because I dislike the taste or texture of the meat itself, but I completely lose my appetite when I bite down on a bone fragment.  It just ruins it entirely for me.    


Impossible's product doesn't subject me to that fear factor and I rather enjoy the alternative.  But when I can get my hands on the real thing, I'm all about it.

The one on the right is plant-based. It was literally produced by turning plants into meat by feeding them to a deer,2,0,terriblefacebookmemes

"I wonder how many of these memes are crafted by someone outside the US and are part of a wider disinformation/divide/disparage campaign by a foreign government to sow discontent among citizens, who no matter their age or party affiliation, if they sat across the table from one another could probably agree on 90% of public policy and cultural issues.",1,0,terriblefacebookmemes

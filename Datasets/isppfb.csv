"Both of my kids (first ended up on formula after BF didn't work out, second EBF) are always skinny. As long as a parent is following doctors recommendations for nutritionists, medical testing to rule out conditions, we have to accept that some kids are going to be on the low side of the bell curve. That's just how math works. My son who has a huge head, is way skinnier than his sister, even though he is at the 10% weight for his age, and she is 5% for her age. She's gained 1 % per year.  They are 6 and 4, and eat lots of non vegan food, non vegetarian food, and still are super skinny.",33,0,insanepeoplefacebook

What exactly do you think this baby should be eating?,12,2,insanepeoplefacebook
"(Not a vegan but I'm a vegetarian)
Breastmilk is widely considered to be in line with vegan philosophy, so assuming proper lactation and production that's good for the start. There are non dairy based infant formula if not, though those are more expensive. 

Once the child can eat solid food, then plant-based proteins like chickpeas, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, etc are good options. B-12 supplements like nutritional yeast are a must, since that's really hard to get through food alone. 

There are other things to consider, but that's the job of a pediatrician and/or dietitian to handle, as they are more qualified than myself, especially if there are health concerns or dietary restrictions to consider. 

Veganism isn't for everyone (in fact it's not even for me but I try to have one or two vegan days per week) but it's possible because science is dope.",54,1,insanepeoplefacebook
This is good info although I'm not sure why you replied to me. I'm asking why these people think it's child abuse to feed an infant a vegan diet... because this kid is like 3 weeks old. Like are they imagining most newborns get steak puree or...?,10,3,insanepeoplefacebook
"The commenter said babies *can* be healthy on a vegan diet. A lot of people seem to have the idea that they can't, which is false. 

The person who replied to you was giving vegan suggestions for what babies can eat, since you had asked what this baby should be eating.

My bet is that you misread the first comment and thought they were saying babies *can't* be healthy vegans, but I may be wrong in that guess.",13,0,insanepeoplefacebook
"Ah nope, I changed my guess. I think you meant to reply to the comment above the one you first did, which just said ""child abuse."" 

In that case, this baby is clearly malnourished. Babies should be pretty fat, they should not have good muscle definition. There's of course too much fat, but chubby babies are healthier.",7,1,insanepeoplefacebook

"> a baby can be healthy on a vegan diet

It doesn't matter whether it's possible. What matters is that the vast majority of the time, those vegan babies are not healthy, and several have died as a direct result of a fucked up diet.

To me, it's a bit like saying ""I want to take a moment to say that a car can go 150mph on the expressway and not crash"". It doesn't state anything of importance.",12,1,insanepeoplefacebook

"In that case, specifically, the child wasn’t malnourished because of a “vegan” diet. The headlines were extremely misleading.

They were malnourished because their parents were absolutely batshit crazy morons who were only feeding  their kids *raw* foods, so the diet didn’t even include basic stuff like grains or pulses. I’m pretty sure they didn’t do any dietary supplements or consult any medical professional ever either.

So saying that case is representative of vegan parenting is a bit like saying that giving a 3 month old baby steak slurpy in a bottle is representative of omnivore parenting. No one with basic knowledge of health and nutrition would do either.

Edit: looks like this was a different case, involving home made veggie and grain based formula. Same point stands — dumb parenting and ignorance.",7,0,insanepeoplefacebook

"I completely support your right to lead a vegan lifestyle. But not every dairy farm (or farm in general) operates to the extent that we see in these exposés. 

Maybe I'm just skewed from living in a small area though, and the fact that the farms in my area aren't huge corporate-run operations with the sole intent of profiting. Most people around here do it to eat, and thus the standards at these local farms are far superior to all the ones I see being petitioned to be shut down.

To me, it's no different than those that hunt to eat versus those that hunt to say they did",-3,2,insanepeoplefacebook

"Obviously not, it involves killing animals",1,1,insanepeoplefacebook
I'm just not sure what your point was though.,4,1,insanepeoplefacebook
"My point was that farming so that your family can eat is akin to hunting so that your family can eat, and that the sort of mass-produced farming that we see examples of all over the internet is like hunting and not using the animal to the fullest extent of your capabilities in that both of these are unethical",2,1,insanepeoplefacebook
"farms can't just sit around losing money, and no matter how much you want to believe it's ethical and that there's no cruelty or exploitation on those farms, there absolutely is.

they're bred to be exploited, they're forcibly impregnated often so they produce milk, and they're sent off to be killed when they stop producing enough. that's their entire life. 

this isn't even going into what happens to the calves.",4,1,insanepeoplefacebook
"Except there's no forcible impregnation at the farms I'm talking about. As I said they live that way to eat, not make money. While I'm not naive enough to assume that all farms engage in the same practices, I was just pointing out that not all farms operate this way. I wouldn't have brought it up if I hadn't have worked there as a kid for spending money and knew what goes on in my area. Now I'd be remiss if I didn't say that I'm sure a few farms in the area operate unethically, but none of the ones I have ever worked at / my friends lived on engage in overly unethical practices to the extent that I've seen on the internet",4,0,insanepeoplefacebook
"There are plenty of dairy operations that dont kill cows and calfs frequently. Also plenty that dont lock there cows in a cage and forcibly impregnate them.

"You talk as if you know this for a fact.. but here i am living on a dairy farm with plenty of cows that have lived a full and natural life span.

We also do not sell our calfs for veal, they are raised with there mothers for beef. 
None of our cows are forcibly impregnated either, we get a bull in once a year and do it naturally.

I drink milk, and its not from abused and exploited cows. That is the essence of what a cow-calf dairy is.

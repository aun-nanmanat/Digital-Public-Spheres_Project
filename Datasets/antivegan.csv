"Veganism isn't just an eating disorder...it's a fucking mental disorder too. I'm currently getting battered by some random vegan troll on one of my post about how vegans are just people who've been coddled from the world. This isn't just people with eating problems but people who also have mental problems who seriously believe they got it down set.

But looking at Suzy Amis Cameron, she's definitely got it down set for her. Those swelled in eyes, those barely there hips, sucked in face, and that killer body! God damn I've never seen a more healthy woman in my entire life! (This is clearly sarcasm)",30,2,AntiVegan
I'm an elderly omnivore and I look way better than that. She reminds me of people liberated from Nazi concentration camps.,10,1,AntiVegan
"I was discussing with a vegan recently who I thought was the same age as me (34). I was actually trying to be nice and I said you don't look too bad for 30. She got SUPER offended. She was 21. She thought I was the same age as her and was INSULTING HER. It wasn't just her weight (she had what looks like a water weight problem, bloating is a sign of early stage malnutrition or thyroid issues) but her face, her posture, everything.... and I aged her without even trying to judge her. I had to think back on it a bit and ask myself why. Anyway...

Lol, I get people who think I'm in my teens sometimes (although I am short af.)",3,0,AntiVegan

"I think a lot of anorexics latch onto veganism as a means to an end.  Then a little wave of the cognitive dissonance wand and they start attacking people for not doing what they do.  If you’re always on the attack, no one will question you.  The best defense is a good offense in this case.",8,1,AntiVegan
"Maybe, that’s definitely not the main reason they would though. As a recovered anorexic who knows a crap ton of others, I know some who went vegan for it, but it was just to limit your intake more and make it easier to lose weight. If you can’t eat a lot of stuff, it’s obviously easier. You can’t just go anywhere and eat or give in and accept things from people easily because you can’t have it. 

Usually they try to avoid talking about it, and anything for animals and stuff would be an afterthought. It’s triggering to open up conversation, so I don’t know why they’d put themselves in a place of fire like that for good offense rather than just as a sad weight loss strategy.",6,0,AntiVegan

"Alright let's be fair here. My dad is 50, eats meat, and looks like he's 65.

Could we at least make fair points instead of comparing just a single example?

There are both plenty of attractive meat eaters and plenty of attractive vegans.",0,4,AntiVegan

I agree. It would be better if they showed a ton of people instead of a really bad case. Genetics can be at play for both people here for all we know,3,2,AntiVegan

Tobacco use is a primary cause of premature aging.,1,1,AntiVegan
"So is not using sunscreen/constant sun exposure, genetics (which effects virtually every physical factor), poor skincare, sleep habits, a bad diet, stress....... etc. 

People have aged prematurely before tobacco, that is not the primary cause. Some people will age prematurely whether or not they smoke tobacco. Your genes kind of determine everything, and looking older when younger is definitely one of them - bad skin, early balding etc easily genetic.

Thanks for the downvote, but you’re misinformed. A simple google search or especially visit to a dermatologist will help",2,2,AntiVegan
"I didn't downvote you. 

You are correct about the other factors, but tobacco is bad.",1,0,AntiVegan

The reason milk has high amounts of B12 is because the cows are supplemented with it the same with meat. Milk/meat is fortified with it because it's hard to find B12 naturally in this day and age. B12 comes from a Bactria that lives in dirt, uncleaned river water and fecal matter.

Since we are very clean and careful with our food we needed to start fortifying our food with it. Soy milk has B12 in it as well and there are supplements you can buy in store as well. 

The animal's food is Fortified with all kinds of vitamins to make it more nutritional and some animals are injected with supplements.

""Sheep and other large livestock such as goats and cattle need B12 for normal growth. *Normally, they can produce it on their own from cobalt in the rumen.* *This is true for all other ruminating animals, including goats, too.*

Unfortunately, vitamin B12 deficiency can occur for several reasons. Usually, this is because of cobalt deficiency in the soil or in the mineral supplementation that you provide your sheep.""

"Did you know the Bible is pro vegetarianism? In ancient Babylon, “Gods people” refused to partake of meat since it didn’t meet their kosher standards so they ran an experiment to see who would look healthier at the end of a span, those eating only vegetables and legumes or those partaking of meat.

According to the Bible “15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children that which did the portion of the king’s meat.
16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink”

As she was one of ""those"" vegans (on the level of our Jehovah's Witness family members), she was... ah, pissed, you might say. We heard about little else for weeks.

But I guess she got used to eating meat again because the complaints died out after a while, and she continued eating it even after her son was born.
